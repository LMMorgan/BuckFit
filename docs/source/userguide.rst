Userguides
==========

These userguides cover building a training set and going through setting up the inputs for the fit and the different parameters which can be set. Following this, there are notebooks which show how to plot the forces, stress tensors, and errors for multiple fits, run a cross-validation, and check the lattice parameters against a reference.

An overview of the capabilities of ``BuckFit``, with example inputs for running the code and varying the simulation conditions can be found in::
