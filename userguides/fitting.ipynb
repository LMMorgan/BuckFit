Lammps does not use species labels but gives them an associated species index. When listing potential pairs, the first index must be the smaller of the two. For example, for LiNiO$_2$, Li=1, Ni=2, and O=3. A potential input or Ni-O needs to be Ni-O (2-3) and **NOT** O-Ni (3-2). For more detail see the [LAMMPS manual](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html).\n",

If you have correctly set your core to the formal charge and the shell to 0.0 then the output `dq_` value needs to be added to the formal charge on the core and subtracted from 0.0 charge on the shell. For example, if you get `dq_O = -3.44` and the core is given the charge `-2` and the shell `0.0` then the charges will be `core = -2 + dq` and `shell = 0.0 - dq` resulting in `core = +1.44` and `shell = -3.44`.\n",
